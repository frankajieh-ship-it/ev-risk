1️⃣ Battery Degradation (Chemistry-Based)
Purpose

Estimate battery aging risk by chemistry, age, mileage, and climate stress.

Key Insight (v1 assumption)

Chemistry explains more variance than brand marketing.

File: battery_degradation.json
{
  "LFP": {
    "base_degradation_per_year_pct": 2.0,
    "base_degradation_per_10k_miles_pct": 1.5,
    "heat_sensitivity_multiplier": 1.1,
    "cold_sensitivity_multiplier": 1.05,
    "notes": "Lower energy density, higher cycle life, slower degradation"
  },
  "NMC": {
    "base_degradation_per_year_pct": 2.8,
    "base_degradation_per_10k_miles_pct": 2.2,
    "heat_sensitivity_multiplier": 1.35,
    "cold_sensitivity_multiplier": 1.15,
    "notes": "Higher energy density, more heat sensitive"
  },
  "LMO": {
    "base_degradation_per_year_pct": 3.5,
    "base_degradation_per_10k_miles_pct": 2.8,
    "heat_sensitivity_multiplier": 1.4,
    "cold_sensitivity_multiplier": 1.2,
    "notes": "Older generation packs, higher fade risk"
  }
}


Why this is safe

Chemistry-level abstraction

Matches multiple public studies directionally

Not VIN-specific (no liability trap)

2️⃣ EPA vs Real-World Range Delta
Purpose

Detect ownership mismatch risk (buyer thinks they’ll get EPA range).

File: range_delta.csv
model,year,epa_range_miles,real_world_range_miles,delta_pct
Tesla Model 3,2019,310,270,-12.9
Chevy Bolt,2020,259,235,-9.3
Nissan Leaf,2018,151,120,-20.5
Hyundai Kona Electric,2021,258,240,-7.0


Usage

If (real_world_range – climate_penalty) < daily_need × 1.5 → ownership risk flag

3️⃣ Recall Density (Platform Risk Proxy)
Purpose

Capture platform maturity & QA risk without deep diagnostics.

File: recalls.csv
model,year,recall_count,critical_recalls,notes
Tesla Model 3,2019,6,1,"OTA mitigated but hardware recall present"
Chevy Bolt,2019,5,2,"Battery fire recall"
Nissan Leaf,2018,2,0,"Minor safety recalls"


Scoring rule (simple)

critical_recalls ≥ 2 → +15 risk points

recall_count ≥ 5 → +10 risk points

4️⃣ Owner-Reported Issue Clustering
Purpose

Surface weak signals that don’t appear in recalls yet.

Method (v1)

Manual clustering from:

Forums

Owner surveys

Public complaint databases

File: owner_issue_clusters.json
{
  "Tesla Model 3": {
    "common_issues": [
      {"issue": "Suspension noise", "severity": "medium"},
      {"issue": "Panel gaps", "severity": "low"}
    ],
    "battery_related_flags": 1
  },
  "Chevy Bolt": {
    "common_issues": [
      {"issue": "Battery recall anxiety", "severity": "high"}
    ],
    "battery_related_flags": 2
  }
}


Rule

battery_related_flags ≥ 2 → escalate battery risk tier

5️⃣ ZIP-Level Climate Classification
Purpose

Apply environmental stress multiplier to degradation & range.

File: climate_zones.csv
zip,climate_zone,heat_index,cold_index
85001,hot,1.3,0.9
60601,temperate,1.0,1.0
55401,cold,0.95,1.3


Usage

effective_degradation =
base_degradation × max(heat_index, cold_index)

6️⃣ Charger Density (High-Level Only)
Purpose

Detect charging dependency risk for non-home chargers.

File: charger_density.csv
zip,chargers_per_10k_people,dc_fast_ratio
85001,12,0.45
60601,25,0.60
55401,8,0.30


Rule

If home_charging = false AND chargers_per_10k < 10 → red flag

7️⃣ Assumptions File (THIS IS IMPORTANT)
File: assumptions.md

You MUST include this. It protects you.

Example excerpt:

EV-Risk v1.0 Assumptions

1. Battery degradation modeled using chemistry-level averages, not VIN-level telemetry.
2. Climate impact applied as a multiplier, not a deterministic failure predictor.
3. Owner-reported issues are directional signals, not defect confirmations.
4. Scores represent relative purchase risk, not guarantees of performance.
5. Data reflects U.S. market conditions as of v1.0.


This is legal + trust armor.

🧠 HOW THIS POWERS THE SCORE (SUMMARY)
Signal	Used For
Battery degradation	Long-term reliability
Range delta	Day-to-day usability
Recalls	Platform maturity
Owner clusters	Emerging failure modes
Climate	Stress acceleration
Charger density	Lifestyle fit

Together → BUY CONFIDENCE SCORE

✅ WHAT YOU HAVE AFTER DAY 3

A fully functional decision engine

No live dependencies

Defensible assumptions

Easy version upgrades (v1.1, v1.2…)

This is exactly enough to launch and charge money.
