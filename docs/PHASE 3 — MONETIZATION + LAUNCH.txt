2️⃣ FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE & EV GROUPS
Strategy: Native, helpful presence in purchase conversations

Templates for FB Marketplace:

Template 1 (Direct Answer Style):

text
"Looking at a 2018 Nissan Leaf with 60k miles?

Quick check: 
• 🔴 High risk in hot climates
• ⚠️ Known battery cooling issues
• 📉 Expect ~65% original range

Free detailed check: ev-risk.com/leaf-check"
Template 2 (General Advice):

text
"Before buying ANY used EV:

1. Check battery health percentage
2. Verify recall status (NHTSA.gov)
3. Test DC fast charging speed
4. Get pre-purchase inspection

Free tool that checks all 4 → ev-risk.com"
EV Group Strategy:

Join 10-15 largest EV owner groups (Tesla, Leaf, Bolt, etc.)

Wait 3 days, observe conversations

When someone asks "Should I buy this used EV?" → Helpful reply with link

Never spam. Only post when genuinely helpful.

Example Group Reply:

text
"I used EV-Risk when buying my used Model 3. Gives you a clear 🟢/🟡/🔴 score based on battery chemistry, climate, and your daily driving. The free check takes 2 mins: [link]

Helped me negotiate $2k off when it showed high degradation risk."
3️⃣ REDDIT (Helpful Answers → Link)
Target Subreddits:

r/electricvehicles (1.2M members)

r/TeslaModel3 (220k members)

r/BoltEV (25k members)

r/leaf (40k members)

Reddit Rules:

10:1 Ratio - 10 helpful comments for every 1 link

Flair: Use "EV Owner" or similar

Disclose: "I built a tool for this..."

Reddit Response Templates:

For r/whatcarshouldIbuy:

text
"Looking at used EVs, the #1 thing to check is battery degradation. 

Quick rule of thumb:
- LFP batteries (Tesla 2021+ SR): Most durable
- NMC in hot climates: Higher degradation risk
- Leaf without thermal management: Avoid in Arizona/Texas

I actually built a free tool that gives you a 🟢/🟡/🔴 score for any used EV based on your location and driving habits. It's saved a few people from bad purchases: [ev-risk.com]

For that 2019 Bolt specifically, check if the battery recall was done. If not, it's actually a great opportunity - they replace with new battery!"
For EV-specific subs:

text
"As a [Model 3/Leaf/Bolt] owner, here's what I'd check:

1. Battery State of Health (ask for screenshot)
2. Recall status for that VIN
3. DC charging speed on test drive
4. Any error codes in service menu

I used EV-Risk when buying mine - it analyzes degradation risk by chemistry and climate. Free version gives you the risk score: [link]

Pro tip: If battery is below 70% health, walk away unless it's practically free."
📱 MESSAGE DISCIPLINE: CONSISTENT BRAND VOICE
Core Message (Repeat Everywhere):
"Buying a used EV? Don't guess the battery. Check risk before you commit."

Message Variations:
Short: "Don't guess the battery. Know the risk."

Problem: "Battery degradation is the #1 risk in used EVs"

Solution: "2-minute check = clear 🟢/🟡/🔴 score"

Outcome: "Avoid costly mistakes, negotiate better"

Visual Language:
Always use 🟢 🟡 🔴 emojis

Always show it's free upfront

Always emphasize "2 minutes" or "instant"

Never use technical jargon (say "battery health" not "SOH")
