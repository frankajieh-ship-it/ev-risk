🚀 PROJECT KICKOFF: EV RELIABILITY COPILOT (MVP)
Product Codename (Internal)

EV-Risk™
(Public name can come later — don’t block on branding)

🎯 LOCKED MVP (Non-Negotiable)

Single job to be done:

Tell a used-EV buyer whether a specific EV is a good or risky purchase for THEIR situation.

Output:
🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 Buy Confidence Score + reasons

Everything else waits.

🧱 PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (Days 1–5)
1️⃣ Define the Scoring Spine (Day 1–2)

You will implement rules-first intelligence (not ML yet).

v1 Scoring Components (Weighted):

Battery Risk (40%)

Chemistry type

Age & mileage bands

Climate stress factor

Platform Risk (30%)

Model year maturity

Recall density

Known failure modes

Ownership Fit (30%)

Real-world range vs daily miles

Charging dependency risk

Climate penalty

Output:
Numerical score → mapped to 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴

This is your IP surface. Document assumptions.

2️⃣ Data Assembly (Day 2–3)

You do NOT need perfection. You need directionally correct.

Initial sources:

Public battery degradation studies (chemistry-based)

EPA vs real-world range deltas

Recall databases

Owner-reported issue clustering

ZIP-level climate classification

Charger density (high-level only)

Store as:

Static JSON / CSV

Versioned (v1.0 assumptions)

3️⃣ Simple Backend Logic (Day 3–5)

Input:

VIN OR (Model + Year + Trim)

ZIP

Daily miles

Home charging (Y/N)

Risk tolerance

Output:

Score

Verdict

Top 3 reasons

1–2 red flags

“What to verify before buying”

No accounts. No dashboards.

🖥️ PHASE 2 — MVP UI (Days 6–10)
4️⃣ One-Page Web App

Above the fold:

“Before you buy a used EV — check battery & reliability risk in 2 minutes.”

Inputs → Submit → Result screen

Result Screen Must Include:

Big 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 indicator

One-sentence verdict

Bullet reasons (plain English)

CTA:

“Unlock full report + negotiation checklist ($15)”

5️⃣ Paid Report (Day 9–10)

Deliverable:

PDF or web view

Sections:

Summary verdict

Battery risk explanation

Platform & recall risk

Ownership fit analysis

What to ask the dealer

When to walk away

This is where trust converts to cash.

💰 PHASE 3 — MONETIZATION + LAUNCH (Days 11–14)
6️⃣ Payments (Fast)

Stripe one-time payment

No subscriptions

7️⃣ Soft Launch Channels

Google Search Ads (high intent only)

Facebook Marketplace & EV groups

Reddit (helpful answers → link)

Message discipline:

“Buying a used EV? Don’t guess the battery. Check risk before you commit.”

Visual: 14-Day Execution Roadmap
4
📊 SUCCESS METRICS (FIRST 30 DAYS)

You are NOT optimizing vanity metrics.

Track only:

Reports generated

Paid conversions

Buyer feedback (“this saved me from X”)

False positives / false negatives

PMF signal:
Users forward reports to spouses / dealers.

🧠 FOUNDER GUIDANCE (Important)

Do not chase ML yet

Do not add more EV features

Do not polish branding early

Your edge is judgment under uncertainty, not UI.
