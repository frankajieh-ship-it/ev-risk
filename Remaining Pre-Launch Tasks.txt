Remaining Pre-Launch Tasks

Critical (Do Before Launch):
Stripe Integration (2-3 hours)
Create Stripe account
Install SDK
Implement checkout session
Add webhook for payment confirmation

Email Capture (1 hour)
Add email field before upsell CTA
"Enter email to save your report"
Builds retargeting list even if they don't buy

Analytics (30 min)
Add Google Analytics or Posthog
Track conversion funnel: Form → Report → Upsell Click → Purchase

Nice-to-Have (Post-Launch):
PDF generation (use jsPDF or puppeteer)
Email delivery after purchase
Comparison feature ("Compare 2 EVs side-by-side")
VIN decoder API integration
Price recommendation based on risk score

Should Fix Before Scaling:
Add email capture for free report users
Add comparison feature - compare 2 vehicles
Add "worst case" scenario toggle - show risks
Add VIN decoder (optional but powerful)
Mobile optimization - check on actual phones

Nice to Have (Post-Launch):
User testimonials on landing page
Sample report preview
Dealer pricing data integration
Battery warranty checker
