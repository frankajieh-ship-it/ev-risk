RECOMMENDED LAUNCH SEQUENCE
Phase A: Friends & Family (Day 1-2)
Share with 10 people who've bought used EVs

Collect specific feedback on trust concerns

Fix critical issues identified

Phase B: Beta Launch (Day 3-5)
Post in 1-2 EV Facebook groups

Offer free reports for feedback

Monitor conversion to paid

Phase C: Soft Launch (Day 6-10)
Enable Google Ads ($100 budget)

Track CAC and conversion rate

Iterate on messaging

Success Criteria for Full Launch:
50+ free assessments completed

5% conversion to paid reports

CAC < $30

Zero "this seems fake" feedback

💡 KEY INSIGHT
The UI looks polished, but the data integrity issues could destroy trust instantly.

Recommendation: Delay public launch by 2 days to:

Fix the input form completeness

Load real vehicle data (2018-2023 models)

Test with actual used EV buyers

Add the paid conversion flow

Better to launch 2 days later with credibility than today with obvious flaws.

❓ DECISION POINT
Option 1: Launch now, risk credibility hit, learn fast
Option 2: Fix critical issues (2 days), launch stronger

My recommendation: Option 2. The product solves a real problem, but trust is everything in this space. One screenshot of "2025 Tesla Model 3 - 0 years old" shared on Reddit could kill the product before it starts.
